1. boundary data exchange
2. configuration file handling
3. output file handling
4. field computation
  4.1 compute Omega
  4.2 compute Psi
  4.3 compute velocities
5. synthetic jet handling
6. field initialization
7. mesh initialization (positions)

File structure:
  config.h/config.c : configuration file dialog
      and reading a configuration file in parallel
  grid.h/grid.c : given info from configuration, generates
      the x and y values of the grid, the DM and DM2 fields,
      and any other constant stuff that is needed.
  field.h/field.c : handles partitioning, allocating,
      and deallocating of a single-value field, given
      the grid size. also handles updating shared
      values in parallel.
  flow.h/flow.c : uses the field functions to compute
      omega, psi, and velocities, also handles boundary
      condiditions
  restart.h/restart.c : functions for printing out
      restart files in parallel and reading them in parallel.
  driver.h/driver.c : gets configuration info and
      handles high-level actions: make fields, give
      to flow functions, print restart files or not
